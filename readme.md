I did not make any of the projects that make this modpack possible.  
Make sure to give some love to the authors of the projects listed in [/mods](/mods), [/resourcepacks](/resourcepacks), and [/shaderpacks](/shaderpacks)!

Unfortunately, some mods I wanted to include do not permit re-distribution.

### ❔ FAQ
<details>
<summary>
<b>What makes this different from other modpacks?</b>
</summary>

Packed aims to keep to the vanilla style, while still providing improvements.

For example, the provided shaderpack options don't make your game look like the latest AAA release.
Instead, the shadows are pixelated, and effects aren't blown out of proportion. The visuals are still amazing, while sticking to "Minecraft".

This also strives to achieve consistency between every element of the game. Information about enchanted books aren't included in the book's lore, rather contained *within* the book itself! Rather than using a mod such as JEI to list recipes, the recipe book is improved with many of the features from said mods.

<summary>
<b>Does this work with OptiFine?</b>
</summary>

No. Nor is this fully compatible with OptiFine resource packs. Packed modpack uses Sodium, Iris, etc.

It includes a few mods that add resource pack features from OptiFine, such as Continuity, but Packed doesn't aim to be fully OptiFine-compatible.

<summary>
<b>Is this modpack laggy?</b>
</summary>

Packed isn't laggy. *However*, it won't be as performant as other modpacks such as [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) or even [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized). This is due to the amount of visual, auditory, and gameplay-enhancing mods in this pack.

The aforementioned modpacks focus purely on squeezing as much performance out of Minecraft as possible, while Packed aims to enhance the client's experience. If your computer struggles with this, give those modpacks a try!
